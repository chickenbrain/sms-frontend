This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How to run

npm i
npm start

# Solution

- URL updates when navigating to different screen to keep UI in sync with the URL
- Integrated with the HTTP API so you will need to use master key
- Design was not the focus however used an existing library to make it look a bit better.
- Test coverage on reducer added
